/**
 * Represents a reference to a [Type] definition.
 *
 * From [the docs](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/text/modules.html#text-typeuse):
 *
 * It may optionally be augmented by explicit inlined parameter and result declarations. That allows
 * binding symbolic identifiers to name the local indices of parameters. If inline declarations are
 * given, then their types must match the referenced function type.
 *
 * ```
 *   typeuse(I) ::=
 *          ‘(’ ‘type’ x:typeidx(I) ‘)’
 *              => x,I′ (if I.typedefs[x] = [t^n_1] -> [t*^2] ∧ I′ = {locals (ϵ)^n})
 *          ‘(’ ‘type’ x:typeidx(I) ‘)’ (t_1:param)* (t_2:result)*
 *              => x,I′ (if I.typedefs[x] = [t*_1] -> [t*_2] ∧ I′ = {locals id(param)*} well-formed)
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:**
 * Both productions overlap for the case that the function type is `[] -> []`. However, in that
 * case, they also produce the same results, so that the choice is immaterial. The well-formedness
 * condition on `I′` ensures that the parameters do not contain duplicate identifier.
 *
 * A `typeuse` may also be replaced entirely by inline parameter and result declarations. In that
 * case, a type index is automatically inserted:
 *
 * ```
 * (t_1:param)* (t_2:result)* ≡ ‘(’ ‘type' x ‘)’ param* result*
 * ```
 *
 * where `x` is the smallest existing type index whose definition in the current module is the
 * function type `[t*_1] -> [t*_2]`. If no such index exists, then a new type definition of the
 * form `‘(’ ‘type’ ‘(’ ‘func’ param* result ‘)’ ‘)’` is inserted at the end of the module.
 *
 * Abbreviations are expanded in the order they appear, such that previously inserted type
 * definitions are reused by consecutive expansions.
