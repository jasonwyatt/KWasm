/**
 * Represents a table in a [Module].
 *
 * From [the docs](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/syntax/modules.html#tables):
 *
 * The `tables` component of a module defines a vector of tables described by their table type:
 *
 * ```
 *   table ::= {type tabletype}
 * ```
 *
 * A table is a vector of opaque values of a particular table element type. The `min` size in the
 * limits of the table type specifies the initial size of that table, while its `max`, if present,
 * restricts the size to which it can grow later.
 *
 * Tables can be initialized through element segments.
 *
 * Tables are referenced through table indices, starting with the smallest index not referencing a
 * table import. Most constructs implicitly reference table index `0`.
 *
 * Note:** In the current version of WebAssembly, at most one table may be defined or imported in a
 * single module, and all constructs implicitly reference this table `0`. This restriction may be
 * lifted in future versions.
