/**
 * Runtime representation of a WebAssembly Table.
 *
 * From [the docs](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/runtime.html#table-instances):
 *
 * A table instance is the runtime representation of a table. It holds a vector of function elements
 * and an optional maximum size, if one was specified in the table type at the tableâ€™s definition
 * site.
 *
 * Each function element is either empty, representing an uninitialized table entry, or a function
 * address. Function elements can be mutated through the execution of an element segment or by
 * external means provided by the embedder.
 *
 * ```
 *   tableinst ::= {elem vec(funcelem), max u32?}
 *   funcelem ::= funcaddr?
 * ```
 *
 * It is an invariant of the semantics that the length of the element vector never exceeds the
 * maximum size, if present.
