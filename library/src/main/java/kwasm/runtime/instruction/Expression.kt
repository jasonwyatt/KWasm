/**
 * From [the docs](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/instructions.html#expressions):
 *
 * An expression is evaluated relative to a current frame pointing to its containing module
 * instance.
 *
 * 1. Jump to the start of the instruction sequence `instr*` of the expression.
 * 1. Execute the instruction sequence.
 * 1. Assert: due to validation, the top of the stack contains a value.
 * 1. Pop the value `val` from the stack.
 *
 * The value `val` is the result of the evaluation.
