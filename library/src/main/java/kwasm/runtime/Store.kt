/**
 * From [the docs](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/runtime.html#store):
 *
 * The store represents all global state that can be manipulated by WebAssembly programs. It
 * consists of the runtime representation of all instances of functions, tables, memories, and
 * globals that have been allocated during the life time of the abstract machine.
 *
 * Syntactically, the store is defined as a record listing the existing instances of each category:
 * ```
 *   store  ::= {
 *                  funcs funcinst*,
 *                  tables tableinst*,
 *                  mems meminst*,
 *                  globals globalinst*
 *              }
 * ```
