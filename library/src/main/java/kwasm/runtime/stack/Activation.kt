/**
 * Represents an Activation Frame in a running WebAssembly program.
 *
 * From [the
 * docs](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/runtime.html#activations-and-frames):
 *
 * Activation frames carry the return arity `n` of the respective function, hold the values of its
 * locals (including arguments) in the order corresponding to their static local indices, and a
 * reference to the functionâ€™s own module instance:
 *
 * ```
 *   activation ::= frame_n{frame}
 *   frame ::= {locals val*, module moduleinst}
 * ```
 *
 * The values of the locals are mutated by respective variable instructions.
