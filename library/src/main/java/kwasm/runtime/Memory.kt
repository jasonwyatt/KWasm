/**
 * Defines runtime memory for use by a wasm program, along with facilities for accessing and
 * mutating memory by the host JVM application.
 *
 * From [the docs](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/runtime.html#memory-instances):
 *
 * A memory instance is the runtime representation of a linear memory. It holds a vector of bytes
 * and an optional maximum size, if one was specified at the definition site of the memory.
 *
 * ```
 *   meminst ::= {data vec(byte), max u32?}
 * ```
 *
 * The length of the vector always is a multiple of the WebAssembly page size, which is defined to
 * be the constant `65536` – abbreviated `64Ki`. Like in a memory type, the maximum size in a memory
 * instance is given in units of this page size.
 *
 * The bytes can be mutated through memory instructions, the execution of a data segment, or by
 * external means provided by the embedder.
 *
 * It is an invariant of the semantics that the length of the byte vector, divided by page size,
 * never exceeds the maximum size, if present.
