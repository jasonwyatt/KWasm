/**
 * From [the docs](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/types.html#value-types):
 *
 * Value types are encoded by a single byte.
 *
 * ```
 *      valtype ::= 0x7F    =>  i32
 *                  0x7E    =>  i64
 *                  0x7D    =>  f32
 *                  0x7C    =>  f64
 * ```
 *
 * **Note**
 *
 * Value types can occur in contexts where type indices are also allowed, such as in the case of
 * block types. Thus, the binary format for types corresponds to the signed LEB128 encoding of
 * small negative `sN` values, so that they can coexist with (positive) type indices in the future.
