/**
 * Parses an instruction given the opcode byte provided, or throws a [ParseException] if no
 * instruction can be found for the provided opcode. Returns null if `end` was read.
 *
 * From [the docs](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/instructions.html#instructions):
 *
 * Instructions are encoded by opcodes. Each opcode is represented by a single byte, and is followed
 * by the instructionâ€™s immediate arguments, where present. The only exception are structured
 * control instructions, which consist of several opcodes bracketing their nested instruction
 * sequences.
 *
 * **Note**
 *
 * Gaps in the byte code ranges for encoding instructions are reserved for future extensions.
